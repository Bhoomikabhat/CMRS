Customer Relationship Management System


Problem Statement
In today's competitive market, businesses must effectively manage their customer relationships to drive growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve decision-making. However, many organizations struggle with fragmented customer data, untracked sales interactions, and a lack of actionable insights.
